## Setup
First, install Redis and start the Redis server.

Go into the server directory, then run the following commands in order:
```
npm install
npm run seed
npm start
```
This will install the necessary dependencies, run the seed task to populate the website with data, and run the server side of our web application.
The server side will run on localhost:4000.

Then, go into the client directory, then run the following commands in order:
```
npm install
npm start
```
This will install the necessary dependencies and run the client side of our web application.
The client side will be hosted on localhost:3000. http://localhost:3000/ is where you will be interacting with our web application.
